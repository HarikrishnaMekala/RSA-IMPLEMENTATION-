## About RSA
RSA is a widely used public-key cryptographic algorithm that enables secure data transmission using asymmetric encryption.
It relies on number theory, particularly the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers, to ensure security.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Code

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HariKrishnaMekala/RSA_Encryption_Decryption.git
cd RSA_Encryption_Decryption
```

### 2. Run the RSA Script
```bash
python Code/RSA_CS22B1031_Implementation.py
```
You will be prompted to enter a plaintext message or file to encrypt and will see encrypted and decrypted results.
